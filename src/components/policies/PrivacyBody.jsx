          store your preferences in order to present contents, options or functions that are specific to you. Like most interactive websites, our website uses cookies to enable the tracking of
          your activity for the duration of a session. Our website uses only encrypted session cookies which are erased either after a predefined timeout period or once the user logs out of the
          platform and closes the browser. Session cookies do not collect information from the user’s computer. They will typically store information in the form of a session identification that

          <p id="div6" className={` text-md md:text-lg`}>6) How we protect your personal information
          We store and process your personal information on our computers in Nigeria. Where we need to transfer your data to another country, such country must have an adequate data protection
          law. We will seek your consent where we need to send your data to a country without an adequate data protection law. We protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative
          security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls
          to our data centers, and information access authorization controls.</p>
          <br /><br />

          <p id="div7" className={` text-md md:text-lg`}>7) How We Share your information within Identiko Integrated Solutions Limited and other users
        During your interaction with our website or premises, we may provide other organizations, with information such as your name, contact details, or other details you provide us for the purpose
        of performing our statutory mandate to you or third parties. We work with third parties to perform Identiko Integrated Solutions Limited services and implement its mandate. In doing so, a

        We will always hold your information securely. To prevent unauthorized access to your information, we have implemented strong controls and security safeguards at the technical and operational
        levels. This site uses Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) to ensure secure transmission of your personal data. You should see the padlock symbol in your URL address bar
        once you are successfully logged into the platform. The URL address will also start with https:// depicting a secure webpage. SSL applies encryption between two points such as your PC and the
        connecting server. Any data transmitted during the session will be encrypted before transmission and decrypted at the receiving end. This is to ensure that data cannot be read during
        transmission. Identiko Integrated Solutions Limited has also taken measures to comply with global Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) standard and we therefore have put in place
        digital and physical security measures to limit or eliminate possibilities of data privacy breach incidents.</p>
